# Dinic's Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of Dinic's Algorithm, a powerful algorithm for finding the maximum flow in a flow network. The maximum flow problem is fundamental in various domains such as transportation, computer networking, and logistics.

## Overview

Dinic's Algorithm is an efficient method for solving the maximum flow problem in a directed graph. It builds upon the Ford-Fulkerson method but improves its time complexity to O(V^2 * E) in general graphs and O(E * sqrt(V)) in graphs with unit capacities.
